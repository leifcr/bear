h1. About

BigTuna is a continuous integration software built on top of the Rails 3 framework. It aims to be project--agnostic and extendible.

This version implements Devise for authentication, it is updated to Rails 3.2, and uses newer bootstrap integration.

It is currently running in-house and works quite well with testing rails/ruby, php and node.js applications.
For rails/ruby applications, I recommend having a .rvmrc file in the project.

h2. Future plans

It's up to what people want, but here are some thoughts:

* Relation between projects/users, and owners/admins
* Removal of unused hooks, and perhaps implement new ones
* Multiple post hooks
