h1. About

BigTuna is a continuous integration software built on top of the Rails 3 framework. It aims to be project--agnostic and extendible.

This version implements Devise for authentication, it is updated to Rails 3.2, and uses newer bootstrap integration.

I'm currently running one instance on a VPS node, and it works quite well for Ruby (Rails/Sinatra), php, and node.js projects. As well as projects using QUnit tests in browsers (Running through selenium).

h2. Users and projects

* A project can have many users and a user can have many projects.
* Any user can see all projects
* Only a user assigned on a project can edit/update/build/remove the project

h2. Future plans

It's up to what people want, but here are some thoughts:

* Improve Relation between projects/users. (Roles for users on site/projects)
* Removal of unused hooks, and perhaps implement new ones
* Multiple post hooks
